Coding Dojo Django assignment "Landscapes"

Landscapes
Create an app that displays a different image to the user depending upon the value the user enters as a url parameter

Display a different landscape photo depending on the value the user passed in as a route parameter.

Have two templates

Display a different landscape photo for each range of values:

• 1-10: A landscape with snow

• 11-20: A landscape in the desert

• 21-30: A landscape in a forest

• 31-40: A landscape in a vineyard

• 41-50: A tropical landscape

There are several ways to approach this challenge. Try to think of at least 2 different approaches. It doesn't matter which one you pick to implement in this case. If you can't think of more than one way, ask someone how they did the assignment.

Optional Hacker Mode: Make sure that users are entering numbers between 1 and 50. Now, display a random landscape image when users enter a prime number.
